## 🌐 High Availability Architecture

This app is designed to stay online, even during backend outages.

### 🛡️ Strategy
- Primary backend: **Vercel serverless functions** or **FastAPI app**
- Fallback backend: **AWS Lambda function** (mirrors same functionality)
- Failover via:
  - **Cloudflare Workers** or
  - **API Gateway** with health checks + routing
- Stateless backend logic ensures easy fallback

### 🔁 Example Fallback Flow

## 🔐 AI Cost Management

- **GPT-3.5** used for Free & Starter tiers (very affordable)
- **GPT-4** reserved for Pro tier
- Prompt/output size trimmed to reduce cost per generation
- Timeline results are **cached**, reducing repeat API calls
- Token usage logged per user to monitor high usage patterns
